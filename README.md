# Data Analysis and Machine Learning using Python

## Introduction

_(adapted from [Step by step approach to perform data analysis in Python](https://bigdata-madesimple.com/step-by-step-approach-to-perform-data-analysis-using-python/))_

>So you have decided to learn Python, but you don’t have prior programming experience. 
>So you are confused on where to start, and how much Python to learn.
>
> These are some of the common questions a beginner has while getting started with Python (for data centric application):

> * “How long does it take to learn Python”
> * “How much Python should I learn for performing data analysis”
> * “What are the best books/courses to learn Python”
> * “Should I be an expert Python programmer, in order to work with data sets”
>
>It is good to be confused, while beginning to learn a new skill, that’s what author of “learn anything in 20 hours” says. 
>
> However the **key word** here is: **Don’t Panic**! This tutorial has been thought and designed to show you that 

### What do you need to get started

Most people have the misconception that performing data analysis in Python requires to be proficient in Python 
programming. 

Coding is fun, but you don't *really* need to be a coding ninja in Python to do data analysis. 

What you just need to get started is some basics of (Python) programming and some very elementary software engineering
concepts, just to avoid disasters when you go in production - whatever _production_ means to you (e.g. deploy a system online, or 
share the code of your prototype or experiments on a public repo for **reproducibility**.)

### What you won't find in this tutorial

In this tutorial, you won't learn how to program in Python. 
If you are looking for a quick tutorial on Python programming, maybe this is the tutorial for you:

### What you will find in this tutorial

For a glimpse on what to expect by this tutorial, I would suggest this `5 mins` reading: 
[5 amazingly powerful Python libraries for Data Science](http://bigdataexaminer.com/2015/05/18/5-amazingly-powerful-python-libraries-for-data-science/) 


## Setup and Installation

To run the code included in this repository, we will be using **Python 3** (which is **not** Python 2, _by the way_).
Although using your Python version (and environment) will be more than fine, for an easier and quick setup of all the 
necessary Python packages, I would **strongly suggest** to download and use the
[**Anaconda Python**](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution.

## Jupyter Notebook Format

(Most of) The materials in this tutorial will be provided as **Jupyter Notebooks**.

If you don't know what a Jupyter notebook is, or how to use it, please take a look at this quick
introductory tour: 
[IPython Notebook Beginner Guide](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

For additional details and materials on Jupyter and IPython, here there are some other suggester readings:

- [Jupyter Notebook the Definitive Guide](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook):
- [What is a Jupyter Notebook](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook#WhatIs)
- [Practical Introduction](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook##UseJupyter)
- [Notebook Examples](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook##NotebookExamples)


## Further Readings

If you want an introductory overview of Python for Data Science, I strongly recommend  
[Scipy Lecture Notes](http://www.scipy-lectures.org): a community driven project where you can find
tutorials (for non-experts) on the scientific Python ecosystems.

Additional Books for further readings:
